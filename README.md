* Bank Telemarketing Campaign Case Study:
In this case study I will be doing Exploratory Data Analytics with the help of a case study on "Bank marketing campaign". 

** Problem Statement:
The bank provides financial services/products such as savings accounts, current accounts, debit cards, etc. to its customers. In order to increase its overall revenue, the bank conducts various marketing campaigns for its financial products such as credit cards, term deposits, loans, etc. These campaigns are intended for the bank’s existing customers. However, the marketing campaigns need to be cost-efficient so that the bank not only increases their overall revenues but also the total profit.
The bank conducted a telemarketing campaign for one of its financial products ‘Term Deposits’ to help foster long-term relationships with existing customers. The dataset contains information about all the customers who were contacted during a particular year to open term deposit accounts.
